# Xpand IT - Frontend Challenge 

This challenge involved developing the frontend of a movie website using Angular, with the UX design and backend API provided. The mandatory requirements included:
- A complete list of movies that allows users to continuously scroll down, with more movies loading automatically as they reach the bottom, until the entire list is displayed
- Clicking on a movie in the list triggers a popup displaying detailed information about the selected movie
- Top 10 movies by revenue and Top 10 movies by revenue in a given year

__NOTE:__ This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.6.

## Development server

Start by running `npm install` to install all the required dependencies.
Next, run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
